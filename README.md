This is a static job listing web site.

The JavaScript code generates a dynamic job board based on data from a data.json file. 
Each job post is displayed with various fields such as job title, company, location, languages, tools, etc. 
The user can apply filters to the job board by clicking on relevant tags, such as programming languages or specific tools. 
When a tag is clicked, it is added to a "filter bar" at the top of the page. 
The added tag to the filter bar filters all job posts wheter they include the added tag.
Clicking on a tag in the filter bar removes it from the filter.
Hidden job posts containing removed tag are added.
The code also contains an event listener for a "clear" button, which removes all filters from the filter bar and resets the job board to its original state.
